    <h1>Too far From Home</h1>
    <p>When I was about <span id="age">__________</span> I had a friend who lived on the block just behind me.
    Though I didn't like them very much, they were my only real choice of someone to hangout with over the summer.
    Having been bored and previously only rode our bikes around the roads nearby we had hatched a plan like none before.
    We were going to ride our bikes to the house of my elementary school crush.
    </p>

    <p>I was smart though, having known my mom was going to yell at me otherwise, I called her via my friend's mom's phone.
    The message appeared jumbled, but I thought I had gotten my point across and she said yes.
    So, off we went. Biking for what felt about 20 minutes, but was actually 10, we arrived.
    Me being embarassed knowing im about to be asking <span id="crush">________</span> to come outside didn't want to open the door.
    To combat this, my friend refused. Begrudgingly, I knock on the door and to my surprise, she answered!
    Happy I didn't have to talk to her parents, we ask if she'd like to come outside.</p>

    <p>
        When she does the hours pass quickly, going from afternoon to probably around 7pm.
        The longest I'd been allowed <span id="thisFar">__________________</span>.
        Realising my mistakes as the sunset was approaching I knew I had to bail.
        With the others trying to convince me otherwise, I set off back to home in a rush.
        When I got home my mom was furious, as expected. She was going on about how I didn't call, mistake 1 of assumption,
        never telling her where I was going, mistake 2 of <span id="mistake2">__________________</span>, and mistake 3 the final stike, not knowing when I'd be home, .
        I didn't get out of this adventure unscathed with a long sentence of grounding.
    </p>
